# Theming
Theming is hell and i hate both gtk and qt

## GTK

install gnome-tweaks, and run the install script from [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/gtk/blob/main/docs/USAGE.md). 

## QT

install kvantum, and install [the catppuccin theme](https://github.com/catppuccin/Kvantum).

## icon theme
i was only able to get [catppuccin folders] to work after installing lxappearance.

## Firefox

[catppuccin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/catppuccin-mocha-mauve-git/)
